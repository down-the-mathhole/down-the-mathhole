        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>Math is dynamic, visually interesting, and accessible to all. 
            Down the Mathhole is an accumulation of my math-adjacent interactive curiosities, written in p5.js. 
            I want to share them in case they inspire others to play with math and gain enlightenment.</p>
        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>I have been using computers to visualize math since 1993. Written in Apple Basic, my first visualization 
                displayed my personal returns in the Stock Market Game. In high school, I wrote programs on my TI calculator to solve and visualize math and physics problems.
                I majored in math and physics at a top US university, where I participated in Putnam, 
                dabbled in high-energy particle physics research, and tutored math and physics (often in an impromptu 
                setting using chalk on walls and sidewalks). I completed my PhD in physics with a research focus on co-evolution and emergent phenomena in spiking neural nets, but 
                my true love was teaching courses and tutoring physics. I used MATLAB to visualize networks for my research and conduction electrons for my students. After grad school, I was a professor at a small college for several years, which felt uncomfortably confining,
                 before I made a transition into the ed-tech industry.
